# MSDM-SLAM
This repository represnets a Metric-Semantic Dense DNN-based Mapping pipeline and a Visual Inertial SLAM system that can be run on a ground mobile robot for the following tasks:
- An accurate automatic indoor dense 3D mapping with objects' semantic annotations. 
- A robust and accurate SLAM system with enhanced version of ORB-SLAM3.
- Supporting 2D LiDAR mapping and navigation on occupancy grid.
